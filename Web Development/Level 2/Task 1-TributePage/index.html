            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
                aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>
            <p>Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace
                engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
                was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He
                was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II
                nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.</p>
            <p>Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
                Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's
                President". He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient
                of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
            <p>
                While delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
                27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where
                he was buried with full state honours. A memorial was inaugurated near his home town in 2017.
            </p>
            <h2>Early life and education</h2>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage center of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil
                Nadu). His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque and his mother,
                Ashiamma, was a housewife. His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and
                Dhanushkodi.</p>
            <p>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and a sister in the family.His ancestors had been wealthy
                Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
                Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and
                local women. The family business had involved trading goods and transporting passengers between the
                Indian mainland and the Pamban Island and to and from Sri Lanka. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
                connecting Pamban Island to mainland India in 1914, the businesses failed. As a result, apart from the
                ancestral home, the other family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, and the family was
                poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy, he delivered newspapers to support the
                family's meager income.</p>
            <h2>Career as a scientist</h2>
            <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence
                Research & Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career, he was involved in
                the design of small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Later, he joined
                the Indian National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram
                Sarabhai. He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S.
                Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.</p>
            <p>
                In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite
                launch vehicle (SLV) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980.
                He had earlier started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam
                received the approval from the Government of India to expand the programme to include more engineers. In
                1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
                and Wallops Flight Facility. Since the late 1970s, Kalam was part of the effort to develop the SLV-3 and
                Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 1974, Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling
                Buddha as the representative of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, even though he was officially
                not part of the project. In the 1970s, Kalam directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant,
                which sought to develop ballistic missiles using the technology from the successful SLV programme.
                Despite the disapproval of the union cabinet, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted funds for these
                aerospace projects under Kalam's directorship through her discretionary powers. Kalam also played a
                major role in convincing the cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified projects. His
                research and leadership brought him recognition in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate
                an advanced missile programme under his directorship.</p>
